      <h2>
      Hello! I am a software developer in training!! I am currently enrolled in the NJIT Full Stack Development Camp!!
      One of my main career goals is to contribute to society. If provided this opportunity, 
      I plan on combining my love for coding with my love for neuroscience. I believe technology, especially software,
       has an extensive ability to aid the betterment of human health and well-being. 
       It is in my interest to explore both the fields of computer science and neuroscience and it would be a further 
       honor if I had the chance to invent or develop a software or device which would help better the health of others. 
       I will use the knowledge I had gained from my ongoing Full-Stack Development Course with my knowledge form my undergraduate degree
       (Biology degree) in order to achieve my goal.
